Place the exported Figma images here so that routes can reference them via <img src="/figmaimages/...">.

Files expected by the Home screen:
- figma_image_1_54.png
- figma_image_1_83.png
- figma_image_1_92.png
- figma_image_1_101.png
- figma_image_1_110.png

Note: The actual PNG files originate from /assets/figmaimages in the repository root.
At build/deploy time, ensure they are copied into this folder.
